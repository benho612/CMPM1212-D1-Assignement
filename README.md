# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to remove _this_ content from their README.md file and replace it with their own project documentation.

Changes (Credits):

<https://inyoo403.github.io/D1.a/> inyoo403 inspired me with me bounce animation on the button. I have made changes to the style.css file by creating an animation named btn-bounce and assigning it a keyframe; each keyframe sets the scale of the image to either larger or smaller. Then, I call the function at the click button listener.

<https://aegismichael4.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1/> aegismichael4 reminds me of the display of the increments. Basically, I create a helper function named spawnFloaty, which spawns a number next to the cursor, and then I set the growth rate to 10% of the current rate. Finally, I called the spawnFloaty at the clickBtn—addEventListener function.
